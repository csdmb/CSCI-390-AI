Software engineering is defined as the application of systematic and quantifiable approaches to the development and maintenance of software. A disciplined approach is essential given the highly
complex software required by businesses and consumers. In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of software engineering including software processes and requirements engineering,
project management, design, testing, and maintenance. Emphasis will be placed on agile software engineering methods and learning through hands-on coding assignments throughout the semester.
Team-based exercises will be used to teach project management skills. Coding will be done in Java, Javascript, and will include exposure to many of the standard tools from the industry.
